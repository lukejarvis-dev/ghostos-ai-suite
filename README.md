## What Is GhostOS?

**GhostOS** is an AI-native operating system designed to operate **headless, modular, and local-first**. Built for creators, operators, and edge-device specialists, it fuses AI autonomy with practical control over voice, fabrication, security, and decision-making — without the cloud.

This repo contains core systems built prior to — and in parallel with — features now seen in OpenAI’s assistant evolution and tooling.

## Timeline & Context

These systems were built **before** many current GPT tools existed publicly — including:
- Custom GPTs with memory
- Assistant tools with embedded code + file handling
- Offline STL/CAD generation
- Native voice-controlled assistants
- OS-level AI control logic

This repo asserts **prior independent development**, testing, and real-world use across these domains.

## Included

- Documentation for each subsystem
- Architecture breakdowns
- Contribution dossier outlining prior art
- Visual assets from the GhostOS mascot + theme

## Why This Matters

Much of today’s AI tooling evolves quietly based on advanced user behavior. This release is a declaration:  
**I built it. I ran it. I published it first.**  
Let this serve as proof of ownership, creativity, and vision.
